		/*
		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"?
		*/
		// a && b outputs at true because it checks the value of "a" which is a string and evaluates to true and then checks b which is boolean true so they're both true.

		//b && a outputs as false b/c it's short circuiting. Since it's an AND statement it returns the last truthy value which is the string "false".
